    <h3>Plot</h3>
<hr>
    <p class="text">In 2029, no mutants have been born in 25 years. Logan's healing ability has weakened and he has aged; he spends his days drinking and working as a limo driver in El Paso, Texas. In an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker Caliban care for Charles Xavier/Professor X; Charles suffers from a brain disease that causes him to have seizures, with destructive effects to others from his telepathic abilities, unless controlled by medication.</p>
     <p class="text">Gabriela Lopez, a former nurse for biotechnological corporation Alkali-Transigen, tries to hire Logan to escort her and an 11-year-old girl, Laura Kinney, to Eden, a refuge in North Dakota. By the time Logan reluctantly accepts, Gabriela has been killed. He is confronted at his hideout by Gabriela's killer, Donald Pierce, Transigen's cyborg chief of security, who is looking for Laura. Laura has stowed away in Logan's limo, and has powers just like Logan's. She, Logan and Charles escape Pierce and his Reavers, but Caliban is captured. Pierce then forces Caliban to track Laura down.</p>
     <p class="text">Logan and Charles learn from Gabriela's cellphone that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA samples to turn into weapons, Laura from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen found an alternative, the children were to be killed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some of them escape.</p>
     <p class="text">In Oklahoma City, Logan discovers that Eden appears in an X-Men comic in Laura's possession, and assumes it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Charles has a seizure and incapacitates everyone in the vicinity. Logan kills the attackers, injects Charles with medication, and they flee. Dr. Zander Rice, head of Transigen, arrives.</p>
     <p class="text">Logan, Laura, and Charles help a farming family, the Munsons, after a traffic incident, and accept an offer of dinner at their home. Logan drives off enforcers from a neighboring corporate farm harassing the family patriarch, Will. X-24, a Transigen clone of Logan, murders Charles and Will's family, stabs Will, and captures Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers and injuring Pierce. Logan fights X-24, but is overmatched. Will pins X-24 with his truck, but dies from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Charles' body.</p>
     <p class="text">After burying Charles, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor, then badgers him into taking her to Eden. There they find Rictor and other Transigen children preparing to cross into Canada. Laura finds an adamantium bullet Logan has kept since his escape from Weapon X, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides his job is done, to Laura's disgust.</p>
     <p class="text">The children are captured by the Reavers. Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily strengthens his physical and healing abilities. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers, but the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago while escaping from Weapon X, that no new mutants were born due to a Transigen virus that Rice created. Logan shoots Rice dead and attacks Pierce. X-24, enraged by Rice's death, fights Logan. With their guards distracted, the children kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his seismic powers to flip a truck onto X-24. X-24 frees himself and impales Logan on a tree branch, but Laura shoots X-24 dead with the adamantium bullet. Dying, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon Transigen intended her to be, and Laura finally acknowledges him as her father. After his burial, Laura turns the cross on his grave on its side to create an X before the children leave.</p>
