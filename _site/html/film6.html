    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="text">Four days after the events of the first film,[5] former assassin John Wick tracks down his stolen 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 at a chop shop owned by Abram Tarasov, brother of Viggo and uncle of Iosef. John dispatches Tarasov's men in a violent fight that heavily damages the Mustang. He then spares Tarasov under the auspices of peace and returns home.</p>
    <p class="text">After Aurelio takes John's Mustang for repairs, John is visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio. It is revealed that to complete his "impossible task"—which allowed him to retire and marry Helen—John asked Santino for help. As a form of contract, Santino swore John to a "Marker," an unbreakable promise symbolized by a "blood oath" medallion.Santino presents the medallion to demand services from John, but John refuses, claiming that he is retired. In retaliation, Santino destroys John's house with a grenade launcher</p>
    <p class="text">Winston, the owner of the Continental hotel in New York City, reminds John that if he rejects the Marker, he will be violating one of the two unbreakable rules of the underworld: no killing on Continental grounds, and Markers must be honored. John accepts his commitment and meets with Santino, who tasks him with assassinating his sister Gianna so he can claim her seat on the "High Table," a council of high-level crime lords. Santino sends Ares (Ruby Rose), his personal bodyguard, to surveil John.</p>
    <p class="text">In Rome, John infiltrates Gianna's coronation party and confronts her. Faced with certain death, Gianna slashes her wrists. Before she dies, John kills her, fulfilling his commitment to Santino. While retreating, John is ambushed by Santino's men, who intend to "tie up loose ends" by killing him. After killing most of them, John is pursued by Gianna's bodyguard Cassian. Their brutal fight is halted when they crash into the reception area of the Rome Continental, which—like the New York Continental—prohibits any "business" on its grounds. As the two share a tense drink, Cassian vows revenge for Gianna's death.</p>
    <p class="text">After John returns to New York City, Santino opens a $7 million contract for John's death under the guise of avenging his sister, leading numerous assassins to attack John. Cassian confronts John once again in the subway. John wins the ensuing fight, but leaves Cassian alive out of professional respect. Injured and desperate, John seeks help from the underground crime lord The Bowery King, whose subordinates treat his injuries and guide him to Santino's location. John kills Santino's bodyguards and mortally wounds Ares, but Santino is able to escape to the Continental. Santino smugly makes it clear that he intends to remain in its sanctuary indefinitely. Despite Winston's warnings, John shoots and kills Santino in the Continental lounge.</p>
    <p class="text">The next day, Winston sends for John and explains that, per the High Table, the contract on John has been doubled and offered globally. Winston declares John "excommunicado" from the Continental, losing all access and privileges to underworld resources. However, Winston delays announcing John's excommunication and global bounty by one hour to give him a head start, and provides him with a Marker for future use. Before leaving, John says to Winston: "Tell them... tell them all... whoever comes, whoever it is, I'll kill them. I'll kill them all." Suspecting hitmen all around him, John runs into the night with his dog.
