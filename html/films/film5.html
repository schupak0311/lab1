    <h3>Plot</h3>
<hr>
    <p class="text">In Liberty City, Miami, Cuban drug dealer Juan finds Chiron, a withdrawn child who goes by the nickname "Little", hiding from a pack of bullies in a crackhouse. Juan allows Chiron to spend the night with him and his younger girlfriend Teresa before returning Chiron to his mother Paula.</p>
     <p class="text">Chiron continues to spend time with Juan, who teaches him how to swim and advises him to make his own path in life. One night, Juan encounters Paula smoking crack with one of his customers. Juan berates her for her addiction and she rebukes him for selling crack to her in the first place. She implies that she knows why Chiron gets beaten up by his peers, alluding to "the way he walks", before going home and taking out her frustrations on Chiron.</p>
     <p class="text">The next day, Chiron admits to Juan and Teresa that he hates his mother and asks what "faggot" means. Juan replies that it is a word that people use to try to make gay people feel bad. He tells Little that it is okay to be gay but Chiron should not allow other people to mock him. After asking Juan whether he sold drugs to Paula, Chiron leaves as Juan hangs his head.</p>
