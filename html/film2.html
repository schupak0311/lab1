    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="text">
        In present-day Paris, Diana Prince receives a photographic plate of herself during World War I, which prompts her to recall her past. The daughter of Queen Hippolyta, Diana was raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazonian race of warrior women created by Zeus to protect mankind. Hippolyta shares the Amazonian history with Diana, including how Ares became jealous of humanity and worked to orchestrate its destruction. When the other gods of Mount Olympus attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who managed to hurt Ares enough to force a retreat. Zeus left the Amazons a weapon, the "Godkiller", to prepare them for Ares' return.
        <br>
        <p  class="text">Hippolyta forbids Diana to train, then relents by having her sister Antiope train Diana, but so long as her training is more difficult than that received by any other warrior in the army. As a young woman in 1918, Diana rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themyscira coast. He is pursued by a German cruiser. The Amazons kill the crew. Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia. He reveals that a war is consuming the outside world, and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook of the Spanish chief chemist Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas, under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff. Diana believes Ares is responsible for the war. She arms herself with the "Godkiller" sword, the lasso and her armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy Ares.</p>

        <p  class="text">In London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council. Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the War Front. Although forbidden by his commanders to act, Steve, with secret funding from Sir Patrick, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief to help prevent the gas from being released. When the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are halted by the enemy lines. Diana pushes alone through No Man's Land and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, while Diana and Steve grow closer romantically and spend the night together.</p>

        <p  class="text">The team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana each infiltrate the party, he intending to locate the gas and destroy it, she intending to kill Ludendorff, believing he is Ares and that killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing the mission; Ludendorff then unleashes the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Outraged, and blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills Ludendorff but is confused when his death does not stop the war.</p>

        <p  class="text">Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, it is ultimately their decision to cause violence as they are inherently corrupt. She attempts to kill Ares with the Godkiller sword but he destroys it. Ares reveals Diana to be the "Godkiller", as the daughter of Zeus, but he fails to persuade her to help him destroy humankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, the others on Steve's team destroy Maru's laboratory. Steve pilots the bomber carrying the gas to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself. Ares attempts to harness Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but memories of her experience with Steve cause her to decide that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares' lightning into him, killing him. Later, the team celebrates the end of the war. In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve, and reaffirms her mission to protect the world.
